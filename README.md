## Notes from xretr0

I have added the versions of the dependencies.

- torch==2.1.0 
- einops==0.7.0 
- transformer_lens==1.7.0 
- plotly==5.17.0 
- circuitsvis==1.41.0 
- numpy==1.25.2 
- transformers==4.34.1 
- sentencepiece==0.1.99 
- scikit-learn==1.3.1 
- jaxtyping==0.2.25

At the moment, the transformers==4.34.1 library has a vulnerability as 
far as I am aware.
